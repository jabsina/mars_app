MarsApp™ is a gloriously pointless mobile & web app, proudly built with Flutter.  
It solves no problems, changes nothing, and still demands your attention.  
Why? Because productivity is overrated.

---

## ✨ Features
- *Sarcastic Pop-ups* – Mock your life choices in real time.
- *Video Backgrounds* – Because static backgrounds are too mainstream.
- *Useless Settings* – They exist. That’s enough.
- *Random Sound Effects* – For no reason whatsoever.
- *Minimal Utility* – Optimized for maximum underwhelm.
